    "This is a web application intended to help learn Farsi. Users can browse phrases, look up phrases in search ",
    "and be quizzed on phrases. If the user does not know the answer to a question, he can flag it as an unknown ",
    "phrase. At the end of the quiz, the user will be shown the phrases that he got wrong. At this point he can ",
    "choose to be quizzed again on the unknown phrases. This process repeats until the user has gone through a quiz ",
    "with out flagging any question as unknown. I found this method to be an effective approach for myself as I have ",
    "been learning the language."

  "motivation": [
    "I began studying Farsi out of interest and to be able to better communicate with my fiance's family who have it ",
    "as their native tongue. Due to the limited amount of resources available, I decided to store phrases in a ",
    "database as I learned them to help me remember. Gradually growing it into a web application seemed the logical ",
    "next step. Another very important factor that impacted my decision in building this app was to improve my skills ",
    "as a developer. I was very interested in learning Angular, Spring, and AWS, and this seemed like a good ",
    "introductory project for me to develop my expertise."

    "of Java Spring and PostgreSQL to fetch and retrieve data. The Angular portion of the app is stored in an S3 ",
    "bucket hosted on AWS and the Java Spring server is hosted on an Elastic Beanstalk instance of AWS. This allows ",
    "these components to be completely decoupled from each other allow them to only communicate via HTTP requests. ",
    "The PostgreSQL database is also decoupled and is stored in an AWS Relational Database Service."
